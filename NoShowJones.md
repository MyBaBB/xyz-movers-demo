This is the Hands Helping  project.  My first real customer,  although I kind of talked him in to it. He will be my success story.

Never mind this guy Didn't not get it.  I was trying to help him thats all.
He said he wanted a "real website"
He can keep advertising on Craig's-list.  
 It was a free chance for him to expand but he insulted me.
